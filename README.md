# Cyclistic-BikeSharing-Case-Study

This is my case study on the "cyclistic" - a fictional bike sharing company. where i worked as junior data analyst and my manager asked me to asnkwer one key question "How do annual members and casual riders use cyclistic bikes differently ?" and main goal of the team was to convert casual riders in to annual members, which is more profitable for the company.
